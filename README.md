# EcoPyCSim
EcoPyCSim (Economical Python Cloud Scheduling Simulator) is a novel multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL)-based cloud scheduling simulator designed for energy-aware job scheduling and resource allocation, implemented as a [PettingZoo](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/PettingZoo) environment.

![EcoPyCSim Framework](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd577dde-f15e-4212-a06e-4ca3765886ef)

It incorporates a Partially Observable Stochastic Game (POSG) model to simulate realistic cloud scheduling environment, and evaluates the MADDPG algorithm on performing scheduling decisions in environment.
